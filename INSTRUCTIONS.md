# Python Skills Assessment Assignment Instructions

## Overview
This assignment consists of six Python programming tasks of varying difficulty levels. Each task focuses on different aspects of Python programming including package management, custom functions, object-oriented programming, and more.

## General Instructions
1. Accept the assignment via the shared link and a personal repository will be created.
2. Clone your repository to your local machine
3. Complete each task in its designated folder
4. Each solution must be implemented individually - no collaboration with other students is permitted
5. Add appropriate comments and documentation to your code
6. Commit your changes regularly with descriptive commit messages
7. Push your completed solutions to your repository to submit.

## Project Structure
Your repository should maintain the following structure:
```
python-skills-assessment/
├── task1-package-management/
├── task2-custom-functions/
├── task3-arbitrary-arguments/
├── task4-basic-oop/
├── task5-inheritance/
├── task6-advanced-oop/
└── README.md
```

## Task 1: Package Management
**Folder:** `task1-package-management/`

Create a Python script `date_calculator.py` that:
- Imports the `datetime` module
- Implements a function to calculate the difference between two dates in days
- Includes proper docstrings with examples
- Handles potential errors when invalid date formats are provided

**Files to submit:**
- `date_calculator.py`

## Task 2: Custom Functions with Default Arguments
**Folder:** `task2-custom-functions/`

Create a Python script `text_formatter.py` that:
- Implements the `format_text` function with default arguments as specified
- Includes comprehensive docstrings with examples
- Validates inputs and raises appropriate exceptions
- Demonstrates proper error handling

**Files to submit:**
- `text_formatter.py`

## Task 3: Functions with Arbitrary Arguments
**Folder:** `task3-arbitrary-arguments/`

Create a Python script `calculator.py` that:
- Implements a `calculate` function using `*args` and `**kwargs` as specified
- Includes helper functions for processing different calculation operations
- Features comprehensive docstrings and error handling
- Demonstrates proper use of arbitrary positional and keyword arguments

**Files to submit:**
- `calculator.py`

## Task 4: Basic OOP Implementation
**Folder:** `task4-basic-oop/`

Create a Python module for inventory management:
- Implement a `Product` class with appropriate attributes and methods
- Include validation for inputs and proper error handling
- Feature comprehensive docstrings for the class and its methods
- Demonstrate encapsulation principles

**Files to submit:**
- `product.py`
- `inventory_demo.py` (optional demonstration script)

## Task 5: Inheritance and Method Overriding
**Folder:** `task5-inheritance/`

Create a Python module for geometric shapes:
- Implement a base `Shape` class and derived classes for specific shapes
- Override methods appropriately in each derived class
- Include proper validation in initialization methods
- Implement string representation methods
- Use class methods where appropriate
- Document all classes and methods with comprehensive docstrings

**Files to submit:**
- `shapes.py`
- `shapes_demo.py` (optional demonstration script)

## Task 6: Advanced OOP with Multiple Inheritance and Custom Iterators
**Folder:** `task6-advanced-oop/`

Create a Python package for a university enrollment system:
- Implement the class hierarchy with multiple inheritance as specified
- Create custom iterators for traversing relationships between classes
- Include operator overloading, type hints, descriptors, and factory methods
- Implement comprehensive exception handling
- Use abstract base classes where appropriate

**Files to submit:**
- `person.py` (base class)
- `student.py` (inherits from Person)
- `instructor.py` (inherits from Person)
- `course.py` (course class)
- `enrollment.py` (handles student-course relationships)
- `teaching_assistant.py` (multiple inheritance example)
- `university_demo.py` (demonstration script)

## Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on:
1. **Correctness**: Does your code work as required?
2. **Code Quality**: Is your code well-organized, readable, and maintainable?
3. **Documentation**: Are classes, functions, and methods properly documented?
4. **Error Handling**: Have you implemented appropriate error handling?
5. **Testing**: Have you included comprehensive tests?
6. **Git Usage**: Have you made meaningful commits with clear messages?

## Submission
By pushing your code you will be submitting your work.(you can push as many times as you want before the deadline).

Remember that this is an individual assignment. Your code should reflect your own work and understanding of the concepts.
